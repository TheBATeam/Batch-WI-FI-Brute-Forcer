This file is intentionally not compiled, if you want to compile this file then you can do it.

we are avoiding compilation:

1. To reduce the size of downloadable zip file,
2. To Prevent it from getting red alerts from virustotal platform.
3. To keep things Simple and Neat.
4. When the Function/Plugin Uses multiple Dependencies, We Don't compile them.
5. When, we think that it is worthless to Complie it - It will only raise VirusTotal False Alarms.
